Description:

This game is a 3D Tower Defense Game powered by UE 4, made with UE 4.22.

It is a personal & learning project made by https://github.com/jsngn (dev) and https://github.com/sethks21 (designer).

Gameplay:

Place turrets on the rocks around the map to kill the enemies. Be carefulâ€”they come in bigger numbers and bigger healths every wave! Get through 11 waves without losing your tower to the invading soldiers to win!

NOTE: If the game crashes on Play or Launch, please go to Project Settings->Maps & Modes, change the maps to something else then re-select the correct maps. This work-around fixes the strange bug for us. If you could let us know why this bug occurs, we would really appreciate it!
